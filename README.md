# Github prebuilt searches
Total searches: `650`

This is a list of prebuilt searches on Github. These searches are useful for finding code, commits, issues, pull requests, packages and repositories.

You can modify the search to narrow down the results.

For example:

`language:python "if "` - [Search](https://github.com/search?q=language%3Apython+%22if+%22&type=code)

I want to find python code that has an if statement with a input( on it so i modify the search to:

`language:python "if input("` - [Search](https://github.com/search?q=language%3Apython+%22if+input%28%22&type=code)

Now i get a list of python code that has an if statement with a input( on it.
